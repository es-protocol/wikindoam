Important Notes

This submission only includes frontend files.

The signup.html page includes a form designed to interact with a backend API (http://localhost:5000/users/signup).
However, since the backend is not required for this submission, it does not need to be running.

JavaScript (scripts.js) is currently empty but reserved for future enhancements.

Responsive Design

The project is built with responsiveness in mind, using:

Media queries with at least 2 breakpoints for different screen sizes.

Flexible layouts to ensure usability across devices.
